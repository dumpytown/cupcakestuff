I've added you as a collaborator to this repo. 

This means that you should be able to clone the repo directly without forking it and that any pushes will roll up into something we both share.

Let's verify by trying to clone this repo by running the following command. 

Be sure that you're in your workspaces directory.

git clone https://github.com/dumpytown/cupcakestuff.git

Let's verify that the origin is still pointing to cupcakestuff repo owned by dumpytown.

cd cupcakestuff

git remote -v

origin	https://github.com/dumpytown/cupcakestuff.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/dumpytown/cupcakestuff.git (push)

That's enough for now.
